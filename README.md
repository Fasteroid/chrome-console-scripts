# JS Global Dumper: Chrome Console Edition
Here's little script you can paste in chrome console to dump all global values.  It can get memory intensive so make sure to bring lots of ram if you plan to explore everything.

This is a skript kiddie tool, so the code is INTENTIONALLY cringe. Please DON'T judge me soley by this.

DISCLAIMER: I do not condone hacking! Do NOT use this to take advantage of poorly written websites!
