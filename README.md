# JS Global Dumper: Chrome Console Edition
Here's little script you can paste in chrome console to dump all global values.  It can get memory intensive so make sure to bring lots of ram if you plan to explore everything.

Please keep in mind that since this is a skript kiddie tool, the code is INTENTIONALLY written with cringe variables like `HACKS.FUNNYMEMES` or whatever.

DISCLAIMER: I do not condone hacking! Do NOT use this to take advantage of poorly written websites!
