# JS Global Dumper: Chrome Console Edition
Paste in chrome console and run to print "all" global JS variables. It can get memory intensive so make sure to bring lots of ram if you plan to explore everything.
This is written like a skript kiddie tool, so the code is INTENTIONALLY cringe.

# JS Function Call Inspector: 
Paste in chrome console and run to attach debug events to "every" JS function in use. If a website already runs poorly, this script will amplify the lag like 50x lol
This is actually meant to be a serious debugging / reverse engineering tool.  Have fun!

I do not condone "hacking". Please do not use these to take advantage of poorly written websites.
