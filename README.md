# JS Global Variable Dumper
Paste in chrome console and run to print "all" global JS variables. Can be memory intensive and will likely lag chrome a lot on big websites.

# JS Function Call Inspector
Paste in chrome console and run to attach debug events to "every" JS function in use. If a website already runs poorly, this script will probably amplify the lag by a lot. Click on function calls in console to expand them and view additional debugging information.
