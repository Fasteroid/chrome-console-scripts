FOREWARD: *Please do not use these scripts to take advantage of poorly written websites!  If you do, you suck!*

# JS Global Variable Dumper
Paste in chrome console and run to print "all" global JS variables. It can get memory intensive so make sure to bring lots of ram if you plan to explore everything. This is written like a skript kiddie tool, so the code is INTENTIONALLY cringeâ€”please don't judge.

# JS Function Call Inspector
Paste in chrome console and run to attach debug events to "every" JS function in use. If a website already runs poorly, this script will probably amplify the lag by a lot. Click on function calls in console to expand them.
