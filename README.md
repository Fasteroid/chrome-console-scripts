# JS Global Dumper: Chrome Console Edition
Here's little script you can paste in chrome console to dump all global values.  It can get memory intensive so make sure to bring lots of ram if you plan to explore everything.

This is a skript kiddie tool so the code is intentionally cringeâ€”please don't judge me based on this of all things.

DISCLAIMER: I do not condone hacking.  Do not use this for evil.
